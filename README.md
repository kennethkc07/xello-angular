Front End Engineering Test

Objective
Create a single page Angular 4+ app with simple routing that has one state/view. In it, place two buttons that when clicked, show a tooltip above the button with some text in it. When button A is clicked, if button B’s tooltip is open it should close and vice versa - only one tooltip should be visible at a time. Either tooltip should close when clicked anywhere outside of it, but remain open if clicked inside. Either tooltip should close when ESC key is pressed.

Implementation
1) Tooltip functionality should be written as a reusable component
2) You are encouraged to use a starter/seed project to save time scaffolding
3) You can organize the files/folders in any way
4) The reviewer should be able to run your solution with a simple npm command
5) You should submit your solution as a github repository link 

Bonus
1) If you scroll down to an open tooltip it should detect being at the edge of the screen and change position to be below the button +++
2) Style using Bootstrap sass ++
3) Add at least one accessibility feature +
